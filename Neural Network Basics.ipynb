    "Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalizaton a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about intitialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout.\n",

First, the gradient of the loss over a mini-batch is an estimate of the gradient over the training set, whose quality improves as the batch size increases. Second, computation over a batch can be much more efficient than m computations for individual examples, due to the parallelism afforded by the modern computing platforms."

Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to eal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem.\n",
    "* \"The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with thier connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different \"thinned\" networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.\"\n",
    "* Dropout is a technique that addresses both of these issues (overfitting and generating various model architectures). It prevents overfitting and provides a way of approximately combining exponentially many different neural network architectures efficiently. The term \"dropout\" refers to dropping out units (hidden and visible) in a neural network. By dropping a unit out, we mean temporarily removing it from the network, along with all its incoming and outgoing connections. The choice of which units to drop is random.\n",
    "* Applying dropout to a neural network amounts to sampling a \"thinned\" network from it. The thinned network consists off all the units that survived dropout. A neural net with n units, can be seen as a collection of 2^n possible thinned neural networks. These networks all share weights so that the total number of parameters is still O(n^2), or less. For each presentation of each training case, a new thinned network is sampled and trained. So training a neural network with dropout can be seen as training a collection of 2^n thinned networks with extensive weight sharing, where each thinned network gets trained very rarely, if at all.\n",
    "* Authors relate the idea of dropout to the role of sexual reproduction for humans. \"Simlarly, each hidden unit in a neural network trained with dropout must learn to work with a randomly chosen sample of other units. This should make each hidden unit more robust and drive it towards creating useful features on its own without relying on other hidden units to correct its mistakes. However, the hidden units within a layer will still learn to do dierent things from each other.\"\n",
    "* \"In a standard neural network, the derivative received by each parameter tells it how it should change so that the final loss function is reduced, given what all other units are doing. Therefore, units may change in a way that they fix up the mistakes of the other units. This may lead to complex co-adaptations. This in turn leads to overfitting because these co-adaptations do not generalize to unseen data. We hypothesize that for each hidden unit, dropout prevents co-adaptation by making the presence of other hidden units unreliable. Therefore, a hidden unit cannot rely on other specific units to correct its mistakes. It must perform well in a wide variety of different contexts provided by the other hidden units.\"\n",
