    "We explore the use of a US firm's SEC filings to predict whether the firm will be an acquirer or a target of an acquisition within a year of the filing. Our approach uses text regression, in which frequencies of words and phrases in the document are used as independent variables in a logistic regression model. We find that word and phrase features have significant predictive power in models of being an acquirer or a target. In each case, the best performing models involve a different use of text alongside standard financial variables.\n",
    "* In this study, we exploit text data to predict whether a US firm will participate in a merger or acquisition. Specifically, we use the disclosure in the firm's Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A), a section of the annual Form 10-K filing. We consider two predictions: (i) will the firm be an acquirer in the subsequent year after the filing? and (ii) will the firm be the target of an acquisition in the subsequent year? We explore the usefullness of text in making these predictions, and demonstrate how text-based forecasting models can offer intuitive hints about upcoming mergers.\n",
    "* Predicting acquirers with both text & financial data: 0.0528 R^2.\n",
    "* Predicting targets from both text & financial data: 0.0294 R^2.\n",
    "* Interestingly, we find that firms that use phrases associated with poor economic performance (such as 'net loss') have higher probability of becoming takeover targets. In addition, phrases that point to potential tax benefits (eg. 'effective tax rate' or 'loss carryforwards') and those that indicate the presence of financial constraints ('credit agreement') imply a higher probability of becoming a takeover target.\n",
    "* We find that, for target prediction, a model that interacts Tobin's Q with text generates the highest predictive power among all the models that we consider, with a pseudo R^2 of 0.0342."

    "Applying a \"co-coverage\" concept to the Dow Jones Newswire articles, we propose to identify each firm's news-based peers (NBPs) and thereby construct a time-varying firm-centric grouping aimed to augment existing industry classification schemes. The advantage o NBP-augmented schemes over traditional industry classifications is to better capture the up-to-date relative importance of the economic links between a base firm and its peers. We show that the base firm's share price responds more favourably to shocks to the stock returns of its NBPs than of its traditional industry peers that are not NBPs. \n",
    "* The response persists for several months, suggesting that the up-to-date relative importance of the economic links is not immediately clear to investors.\n",
    "* Why use text data? First, unlike time-invariant traditional industry classifications or annual classfication schemes based on the 10-K updates, the up-to-date economic link between firms can be promptly picked up by journalists and revealed in news articles. Second, the number of news articles covering each link between firms provides a natural objective scheme to weigh the relative importance of the links. As such, co-coverage news offers a potential wisdom-of-the-crowd solution to rate the links between firms, unlike the lack of differentiation among the links between firms of a traditional industry (eg. based on SIC code).\n"
